# My Personal Project

## Personal Gym Log

### What will the application do?

The application will allow users to record and keep track of various gym exercises containing
information on the target muscle they target, the type of exercise it is (e.g., weight or calisthenics), the amount of
weight (if type weight), and the number of sets and repetition the users prefer. Functionalities to the application
include being able to categorize groups of exercises based on the muscles they target and track progress on the 
increase of weights, sets, or repetitions.

### Who will use it?

The application is open to anyone who is looking to start getting fit in the gym, or even for experienced gym goers who
are looking to record their progress. It will be useful because it conveniently allows people who want to work out to
keep track of what exercises they should do and see their progress over time.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me because going to the gym and working out is a hobby of mine. Moreover, I believe
in personal fitness and health and how it improves quality of life both mentally and physically, allowing people to 
grow, improve, and participate in a challenging, yet rewarding endeavour. Due to the growing number of people who are
abstaining from personal fitness, I reckon that increasing the convenience with the process of working out will allow
that abstinence to change for the betterment of quality of life.
