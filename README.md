# My Personal Project

## Gym Exercise Repository

### What will the application do?

The application will allow users to document, organize, and record various gym exercises containing
information on muscle groups they target, their difficulty from novice and advanced, the amount of weight, and the 
number of sets and repetition the users prefer. Functionalities to the application include being able to categorize
groups of exercises based on the muscles they target and their subjective difficulty.

### Who will use it?

The application is open to anyone who is looking to start working out, or even for experienced gym goers who are 
looking to record their progress. It will be useful because it conveniently allows people who want to work out to track
what exercises they should do, how they should do it, and quantify its difficulty for when they actually go out to 
workout.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me because going to the gym and working out is a hobby of mine. Moreover, I believe
in personal fitness and health and how it improves quality of life both mentally and physically, allowing people to 
grow, improve, and participate in a challenging, yet rewarding endeavour. Due to the growing number of people who are
abstaining from personal fitness, I reckon that increasing the convenience with the process of working out will allow
that abstinence to change for the betterment of quality of life.
